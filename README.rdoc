This project creates a user interface for music playlists. It follows a tutorial found at [Turing](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/mix_master/1_getting_started.markdown).
Creating the music playlists offered the opportunity to explore one-to-many and many-to-many data relationships.

During the project, I used RSpec and Capybara for feature testing, and RSpec for model tests. I also used FactoryGirl to create factories for testing purposes.
Additionally, this project implemented authentication using the Spotify OAuth.

After finishing, I deployed the app to Heroku.
